Drupal PHPWord
==============

Pull requests more than welcome.

Comes without warranty and has only been used in closed-source projects, aka never "in the wild", so there's no real documentation and it's light on tests.

Will require that PHPWord is extracted to the `sites/all/libraries` folder, so that there exists a file named `sites/all/libraries/phpword/src/PhpWord/PhpWord.php`. Hopefully all dependencies should be met, but, as before, is without warranty!
